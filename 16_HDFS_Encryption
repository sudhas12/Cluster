#### Pre-Reuqisites - TLS/SSL, Kerberos enabed. KMS/KTS services installed
# sudo -u hdfs is not included in the commands below. This is because it is not required if
# Kerberos is enabled on your cluster. However, need to have Kerberos credentials for the HDFS
# super user in order to successfully run these commands

###Create a HDFS Encryption key
# if kerberos is enabled only a user with admin privileges in KTS  can create a key. hdfs does not work
hadoop key create <hdfs_encrypt_key>

#### Create an empty encryption zone directory
# if kerberos is enabled, make sure kerberos principal is hdfs<servername> (kinit hdfs)
hdfs dfs -mkdir /encryption_zone_name

#### Make the directory an encryption zone.
# if kerberos is enabled, make sure kerberos principal is hdfs (kinit hdfs)
hdfs crypto -createZone -keyName <hdfs_encrypt_key> -path </path/to/encryption_zone_name>

#### Verify encryption zone is created correctly by listing the encryption zone and keyname
# if kerberos is enabled, make sure kerberos principal is hdfs/<servername> (kinit hdfs)
# Note: Command is case sensitive
hdfs crypto -listZones
