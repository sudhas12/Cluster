# Cloudera Director install does not include a Spark Service install.
# Spark has to added a separate service after deploying CDH using CSDs.
# Spark 2 and above requires Java 8 (1.8). By default Cloudera Director installs Java 1.7.
# This can be overriden during CM and CDH deploy by director in two ways:
                   1. Modifying the director config file directly
                   2. By using the Director API
#
#Link below shows the process for deploying a Java 8 cluster through director.
# This cannot be done using Web UI in Director 5.6 and we have to use a config file.

# Director configuration file

# In case, Web UI is being used to deploy CDH, the following are the steps for upgrading to Java 8.
# First, download the Java 8 Jar file and copy to /usr/java
  https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-10-x/topics/cdh_cm_upgrading_to_jdk8.html

# Stop the Cloudera Management Service.
# Stop all clusters.
# Stop all Cloudera Manager Agents.
# Stop the Cloudera Manager Server.
# Clean up existing Java versions (this is optional)
# In the Cloudera Manager Server host and each cluster host:
# https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/5-10-x/topics/cdh_ig_jdk_installation.html
# Install the same version of the Oracle JDK on each host.
# Install the JDK in /usr/java/jdk-version.
# sudo yum install wget
* Copy the download link of jdk-8u102-linux-x64.rpm and wget it.
# Go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html and copy teh link . The link below may not work
    wget --header "Cookie: oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie"
  http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u102-b14/jdk-8u102-linux-x64.rpm
* Install with yum localinstall:
      sudo yum localinstall jdk-8u144-linux-x64.rpm
* Alternatively, Download the .tar.gz file for one of the supported versions of the Oracle JDK from Java SE 8 Downloads or Java SE 7 Downloads.
* Extract the JDK to /usr/java/jdk-version; for example /usr/java/jdk.1.7.0_nn or /usr/java/jdk.1.8.0_nn, where nn is a supported version.
Set JAVA_HOME to the directory where the JDK is installed. Add the following line to the specified files:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk.1.8.0_nn
Cloudera Manager Server host: /etc/default/cloudera-scm-server.
#This affects only the Cloudera Manager Server process, and does not affect the Cloudera Management Service roles.you can use
# Use instructions below to Configure a Custom Java Home Location.
# This change affects all CDH processes and Cloudera Management Service roles in the cluster.
   Open the Cloudera Manager Admin Console.
   In the main navigation bar, click the Hosts tab and optionally click a specific host link.
   Click the Configuration tab.
   Select Category > Advanced.
   Set the Java Home Directory property to the custom location.
   Click Save Changes.
   Restart all services.
