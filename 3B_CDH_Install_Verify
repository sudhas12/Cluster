* First step is to verify if cluster is installed 
* Verify HDFS
hdfs dfs -ls 
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/user1
hdfs dfs -chown user1:user1 /user/user1


Next verify a Hadoop pi works
https://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_ig_testing_the_install.html

Run the Hadoop PiEstimator example using one of the following commands:
For Parcel installation - 
sudo -u hdfs hadoop jar /opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples.jar pi 10 100

With	Cloudera	Manager	managed	clusters,	the	cloudera-manager-agent
service	on	each	cluster	node manages	starting	and	stopping the	deployed	
Hadoop	daemons. 

sudo jps

The	Hadoop	daemons	run	as	Java	processes.	You	should	see	the	NodeManager,	
NameNode,	and	DataNode	processes	running with above command


You	will see	details	about	the	process.
If	you	grep	for	DATANODE	or	NODEMANAGER	you	will	see	details	on	those	
processes.		Grep	for	“cloudera” to	see	all	CDH	and	Cloudera	Manager	processes	
currently	running	on	the	machine.

Another way to verify is to put soem data into cluster

cd $home
vi test.txt (add some data and save file)
hdfs dfs -put test.txt /tmp
hdfs dfs -ls  /tmp
