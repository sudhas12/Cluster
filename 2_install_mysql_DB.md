##<center>Install and Configure MySQL with a replica server including mysql client and JDK 
### Install SQL-Server and SQL-Client
1. Download the rpm  
 * wget http://repo.mysql.com/mysql-community-release-el6.rpm  
 
2a. Install the rpm  
 * rpm -ivh mysql-community-release-el6.rpm 

2b. Verify rpm was installed
 * rpm -qa | grep ysql
 
3. Update/refresh the yum repo 
 * yum update -y mysql-5.1.73-8.el6_8.x86_64   
 Â  mysql-libs-5.1.73-8.el6_8.x86_64
 
4. Check which versions are enabled   
 * yum repolist all | grep mysql  
 
   mysql-connectors-community        MySQL Connectors Community     enabled:     39  
   mysql-connectors-community-source MySQL Connectors Community - S disabled   
   mysql-tools-community             MySQL Tools Community          enabled:     49   
   mysql-tools-community-source      MySQL Tools Community - Source disabled   
   mysql55-community-source          MySQL 5.5 Community Server - S disabled   
   mysql56-community                 MySQL 5.6 Community Server     enabled:    377   
   mysql56-community-source          MySQL 5.6 Community Server - S disabled   
   mysql57-community                 MySQL 5.7 Community Server     disabled   
   mysql57-community-source          MySQL 5.7 Community Server - S disabled    

5. Disable mysql version 6 and enable version 5 
 * yum-config-manager --disable mysql56-community 
 * yum-config-manager --enable mysql55-community 

   mysql55-community                 MySQL 5.5 Community Server     disabled   
6. ######Altenatively use vi to enable version 5 and disable version 5.  
   *   vi /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql-community.repo 
   *   Set enabled=1 for version 5.5 and set enabled=0 for the remaining versions 

7. Verify that only version 5.5 is enabled  
 * yum repolist all | grep mysql 

8. Install mysql-server AND mysql (client) on node 1 and node 2
 * yum install mysql-server mysql -y  (or yum install mysql-community-server)

9. Install just mysql (client) on remaining nodes 
 * yum install mysql -y (sudo yum install mysql-community)

10. Start mysql service
 * service mysqld start
 * NOTE:  If there are errors related to tables and if the error msg indicates that mysql_upgrade needs to be run, then run it while mysqld service is running. Execute command not from within mysql but as a shell command
 * mysql_upgrade
 * service mysqld restart 
 
 11. Following steps below for configuring a HA server on first master node  
 *  (Add following lines after [mysqld)

14. Create a new user     
 *    CREATE USER 'slave-user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'slave-password';       

15. execute following cmd within mysql   
 *  mysql> GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'slaveuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'cloudera';      
 *  mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;     
 *  mysql> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK; 
 *  mysql> SHOW MASTER STATUS;

17. Secure MySQL installation using  
 *    /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation      

NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MySQL 
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY! 
 
In order to log into MySQL to secure it, we'll need the current 
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MySQL, and  
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank, 
so you should just press enter here. 

Enter current password for root (enter for none):  
OK, successfully used password, moving on... 

Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MySQL 
root user without the proper authorisation. 

Set root password? [Y/n] y 
New password:  
Re-enter new password:  
Password updated successfully!
Reloading privilege tables..
 ... Success!


By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user, allowing anyone
to log into MySQL without having to have a user account created for
them.  This is intended only for testing, and to make the installation
go a bit smoother.  You should remove them before moving into a
production environment. 

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!

Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from 'localhost'.  This
ensures that someone cannot guess at the root password from the network.

Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] n
 ... skipping.

By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that anyone can
access.  This is also intended only for testing, and should be removed
before moving into a production environment.

Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
 - Dropping test database...
ERROR 1008 (HY000) at line 1: Can't drop database 'test'; database doesn't exist
 ... Failed!  Not critical, keep moving...
 - Removing privileges on test database...
 ... Success!

Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes made so far
will take effect immediately.

Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
 ... Success!
