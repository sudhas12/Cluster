Recommended specifications for NameNode/JobTracker/Standby NameNode nodes. 
The drive count will fluctuate depending on the amount of redundancy:

4â€“6 1TB hard disks in a JBOD configuration (1 for the OS, 2 for the FS image [RAID 1], 1 for Apache ZooKeeper, and 1 for Journal node)
2 quad-/hex-/octo-core CPUs, running at least 2-2.5GHz
64-128GB of RAM
Bonded Gigabit Ethernet or 10Gigabit Ethernet

Recommended specifications for DataNode/TaskTrackers in a balanced Hadoop cluster:

12-24 1-4TB hard disks in a JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks) configuration
2 quad-/hex-/octo-core CPUs, running at least 2-2.5GHz
64-512GB of RAM
Bonded Gigabit Ethernet or 10Gigabit Ethernet (the more storage density, the higher the network throughput needed)
